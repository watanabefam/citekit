## Keep a durable record of every amendment (mandatory)

The core step writes a **Sync Impact Report** into the constitution and then expects it removed
before commit. That is deliberate — it is review material, not governance content. But the
consequence is that an amendment's **reasoning does not survive its own commit**, and a rule whose
factual premise later goes stale cannot be detected by anyone reading the result.

A rule with no recorded rationale leaves a future reader exactly two choices: accept it blindly, or
change it blindly. Both are wrong when the context has moved, and this is a well-documented failure
— hence the established practice of **architecture decision records**, which exist to preserve the
motivation behind a decision rather than only its outcome. Follow that shape.

### Write the record in the same change

1. Create the record **in the same change as the amendment**, not afterwards. An amendment whose
   record is deferred never gets one.
2. Choose its home by whether the amendment belongs to a spec:
   - **Belongs to a spec** → `decision.md` inside that spec's folder.
   - **A standalone amendment** → a file in a `decisions/` folder at the repository root.
3. Reference it from the constitution so the result points at the reasoning (a relative path from
   the constitution to the record is enough). The Sync Impact Report will be deleted; the pointer
   must not depend on it.

### The record's shape

- **Title** — a short noun phrase naming the decision, not the topic.
- **Context** — the forces in tension, value-neutral. Facts, not advocacy.
- **Decision** — in full sentences, active voice, "We will …". **One decision per record.**
- **Status** — `Proposed` / `Accepted` / `Superseded by <record>`.
- **Consequences** — the resulting context. Include the **negative** consequences and any
  follow-up records this one implies.
- **Evidence** — what the decision rests on, with identifiers, and the **confidence** level.

### Rules

1. **Number sequentially and monotonically; never reuse a number.** Where several records may start
   in parallel, key the number to the work item rather than racing an ascending counter.
2. **Immutable once accepted.** Do not edit an accepted record's Context or Decision. To change the
   decision, write a **new** record and mark the old one `Superseded by <new>`, linking both ways.
   This preserves *when* and *why* the direction shifted.
3. **Always include Context and Consequences.** A record without a rationale loses its value the
   moment circumstances change, because nobody can judge whether it still applies.
4. **Name and cite any external premise the decision depends on.** An unrecorded factual premise is
   the usual reason a rule silently goes wrong; recording it is what makes re-checking possible.
   State the confidence, and let a low-confidence premise be visibly low-confidence.
5. **Record only significant, hard-to-reverse decisions.** A record for everything buries the ones
   that matter.

The record is a **governance artifact**: it is not deleted while the decision it describes is in
force, and it is never amended in place to say something the original decision did not say.



## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Scope Guard

This command's own work is limited to updating the project constitution itself. Dependent templates
and commands read the constitution at runtime and are not modified here.

- Classify every part of the user input as either constitution content or a separate,
  non-governance intent.
- If the input includes feature implementation, code generation, refactoring, building, or
  deployment requests, you **MUST NOT** execute them. Extract them as deferred intents instead.
- You **MUST NOT** create, modify, or delete application source files, feature routes,
  components, tests, deployment files, or other artifacts unrelated to the constitution
  workflow.
- If it is unclear whether an instruction is constitution content, ask for clarification before
  making changes.
- After completing the constitution update, include a `Next Actions` section for each deferred
  intent. List the original intent and suggest the appropriate follow-up Spec Kit command, such
  as `/speckit.specify`, without invoking it.
- If there are no non-governance intents, omit the `Next Actions` section.

## Pre-Execution Checks

**Check for extension hooks (before constitution update)**:
- Check if `.specify/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
- If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.before_constitution` key
- If the YAML cannot be parsed or is invalid, do not skip silently: tell the user that `.specify/extensions.yml` could not be read (include the parser error) and that no hooks were checked, including any mandatory (`optional: false`) hooks registered there, then continue normally
- Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`. Treat hooks without an `enabled` field as enabled by default.
- For each remaining hook, do **not** attempt to interpret or evaluate hook `condition` expressions:
  - If the hook has no `condition` field, or it is null/empty, treat the hook as executable
  - If the hook defines a non-empty `condition`, skip the hook and leave condition evaluation to the HookExecutor implementation
- For each executable hook, output the following based on its `optional` flag:
  - **Optional hook** (`optional: true`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Optional Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Command: `/{command}`
    Description: {description}

    Prompt: {prompt}
    To execute: `/{command}`
    ```
  - **Mandatory hook** (`optional: false`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Automatic Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Executing: `/{command}`
    EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}

    Wait for the result of the hook command before proceeding to the Outline.
    ```
    After emitting the block above you MUST actually invoke the hook and wait for it to finish before continuing. Run it the same way you would run the command yourself in this agent/session (the invocation may differ from the literal `{command}` id shown above, e.g. a skills-mode agent runs it as `/skill:speckit-...` or `$speckit-...`). Emitting the block alone does not run the hook.
- If no hooks are registered or `.specify/extensions.yml` does not exist, skip silently

## Outline

You are updating the project constitution at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`. The active
constitution scaffold is resolved at command time from `constitution-template` through the Spec Kit
preset/template resolution stack.

Follow this execution flow:

1. Run `.specify/scripts/bash/resolve-template.sh constitution-template --json` from the repository root and parse `TEMPLATE_CONTENT` as the active template.
   - The shared resolver applies project overrides, composing preset layers, and extension layers
     before the core template fallback. It MUST succeed before continuing.
   - If it fails, stop and report the resolution error; do not continue with only one contributing
     template layer.
   - If `.specify/memory/constitution.md` exists, load it as the source of current project-specific
     values and amendments. Preserve information that is still applicable when applying the newly
     resolved scaffold.
   - If it does not exist, use the resolved template as the initial document.
   - Do not write back to any versioned template layer.
   - Identify every placeholder token of the form `[ALL_CAPS_IDENTIFIER]`.
   **IMPORTANT**: The user might require less or more principles than the ones used in the template. If a number is specified, respect that - follow the general template. You will update the doc accordingly.

2. Collect/derive values for placeholders:
   - If user input (conversation) supplies a value, use it.
   - Otherwise infer from existing repo context (README, docs, prior constitution versions if embedded).
   - For governance dates: `RATIFICATION_DATE` is the original adoption date (if unknown ask or mark TODO), `LAST_AMENDED_DATE` is today if changes are made, otherwise keep previous.
   - `CONSTITUTION_VERSION` must increment according to semantic versioning rules:
     - MAJOR: Backward incompatible governance/principle removals or redefinitions.
     - MINOR: New principle/section added or materially expanded guidance.
     - PATCH: Clarifications, wording, typo fixes, non-semantic refinements.
   - If version bump type ambiguous, propose reasoning before finalizing.

3. Draft the updated constitution content using the resolved template as the required structure:
   - Replace every placeholder with concrete text (no bracketed tokens left except intentionally retained template slots that the project has chosen not to define yet—explicitly justify any left).
   - Preserve heading hierarchy and comments can be removed once replaced unless they still add clarifying guidance.
   - Ensure each Principle section: succinct name line, paragraph (or bullet list) capturing non‑negotiable rules, explicit rationale if not obvious.
   - Ensure Governance section lists amendment procedure, versioning policy, and compliance review expectations.

4. Produce a Sync Impact Report as an HTML comment at the top of the constitution file after update.
   This report is temporary scratch material for human review of the amendment, not governance
   content; it is expected to be removed before the amended constitution file is committed.
   - Version change: old → new
   - List of modified principles (old title → new title if renamed)
   - Added sections
   - Removed sections
   - Follow-up TODOs if any placeholders intentionally deferred.

5. Validation before final output:
   - No remaining unexplained bracket tokens.
   - Version line matches report.
   - Dates ISO format YYYY-MM-DD.
   - Principles are declarative, testable, and free of vague language ("should" → replace with MUST/SHOULD rationale where appropriate).

6. Write the completed constitution back to `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (overwrite).

7. Output a final summary to the user with:
   - New version and bump rationale.
   - Any TODO placeholders or deferred items requiring manual follow-up.
   - Suggested commit message (e.g., `docs: amend constitution to vX.Y.Z (principle additions + governance update)`).
   - A `Next Actions` section for any deferred non-governance intents.

Formatting & Style Requirements:

- Use Markdown headings exactly as in the template (do not demote/promote levels).
- Wrap long rationale lines to keep readability (<100 chars ideally) but do not hard enforce with awkward breaks.
- Keep a single blank line between sections.
- Avoid trailing whitespace.

If the user supplies partial updates (e.g., only one principle revision), still perform validation and version decision steps.

If critical info missing (e.g., ratification date truly unknown), insert `TODO(<FIELD_NAME>): explanation` and include in the Sync Impact Report under deferred items.

Write only `.specify/memory/constitution.md`; do not create or modify template source files.

## Post-Execution Checks

**Check for extension hooks (after constitution update)**:
Check if `.specify/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
- If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.after_constitution` key
- If the YAML cannot be parsed or is invalid, do not skip silently: tell the user that `.specify/extensions.yml` could not be read (include the parser error) and that no hooks were checked, including any mandatory (`optional: false`) hooks registered there, then continue normally
- Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`. Treat hooks without an `enabled` field as enabled by default.
- For each remaining hook, do **not** attempt to interpret or evaluate hook `condition` expressions:
  - If the hook has no `condition` field, or it is null/empty, treat the hook as executable
  - If the hook defines a non-empty `condition`, skip the hook and leave condition evaluation to the HookExecutor implementation
- For each executable hook, output the following based on its `optional` flag:
  - **Optional hook** (`optional: true`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Optional Hook**: {extension}
    Command: `/{command}`
    Description: {description}

    Prompt: {prompt}
    To execute: `/{command}`
    ```
  - **Mandatory hook** (`optional: false`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Automatic Hook**: {extension}
    Executing: `/{command}`
    EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}
    ```
    After emitting the block above you MUST actually invoke the hook and wait for it to finish before continuing. Run it the same way you would run the command yourself in this agent/session (the invocation may differ from the literal `{command}` id shown above, e.g. a skills-mode agent runs it as `/skill:speckit-...` or `$speckit-...`). Emitting the block alone does not run the hook.
- If no hooks are registered or `.specify/extensions.yml` does not exist, skip silently
